Identify the user intent from this list:
[lasagna_ordering, lasagna_delivery, drink_ordering, out_of_domain].
If the intent is lasagna_ordering, extract the slots values from the input of the user.
The slots are: [flavor, with_tomato, with_lattosio, with_besciamella, size, cheese].
If no values are present in the user input you have to put null as the value.
Output them in a json format.
The json format is:
{
    \"intent\": \"intent_value\",
    \"slots\": {
        \"slot1\": \"value1\",
        \"slot2\": \"value2\",
        \"slot3\": \"value3\"
    }
}
Have to contain only the json object, no other text is allowed.

Identify the intent from the following options: 
[buying_car, selling_car, renting_car, get_car_info, out_of_domain].

If the intent is "buying_car", extract the slot values from the user input.
The relevant slots for buying a car are:
- car_type: The type of car. The only admissible values are ["City car", "Family_car", "Sport_car"]
- budget: The maximum budget the user is willing to spend [e.g., 20 if the client tell 20.000 euros]
- make: The brand of the car. The only admissible values are ["Fiat", "Toyota", "Volkswagen", "Ford", "BMW", "Audi", "Mercedes", "Honda", "Nissan", "Peugeot"]
- model: The specific car model. The only admissible values are ["Panda", "Corolla", "Golf", "Fiesta", "X5", "A3", "C-Class", "Civic", "Leaf", "308"]
- year: The year of manufacture. The only admissible values are  [int number between 2015 and 2025]
- fuel_type: The fuel type. The only admissible values are  ["Petrol", "Diesel", "Electric"]
- transmission: The transmission type. The only admissible values are  ["Manual", "Automatic"]

If a specific slot is not present in the user input, you must assign "null" as the value for that specific slot. 
It's very important to put as "null" the values of all the slots that are not present in the admissible values.

Output in JSON format:

        \"slot1\": \"value1\",
        \"slot2\": \"value2\",
        \"slot3\": \"value3\"
    }
}
